Regarding my work history and academics, I have a high school degree. I am currently enlisted in Wake Tech  Community College, pursuing an associate's degree in web and program development, and looking to get my CCNA (certification for cyber security) through Cisco.

For my work history, I started working at Subway when I turned 16 and worked there for two months.
My second job was at Bojangles when I was 16, I was there for two years.
My most recent job was at Witherspoon Rose gardening culture company started working there when I was 19, and I was there for five months.

Starting in school, I wasn't the brightest kid in the class I did not enjoy the curriculum being taught when I was younger cuz I had no interest in it but over time, I got used to it and enjoyed some of the subjects that were being explicitly taught in middle school and in high school where their history was my favorite as well as biology, English, and writing.
