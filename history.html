        <h2>History</h2>
        <p> 
          Regarding my work history and academics, I have a high school degree. I am currently enlisted in Wake Tech  Community College, pursuing an associate's degree in web and program development, and looking to get my CCNA (certification for cyber security) through Cisco.

          Starting in school, I wasn't the brightest kid in the class I did not enjoy the curriculum being taught when I was younger because I had no interest in it but over time, I got used to it and enjoyed some of the subjects that were being explicitly taught in middle school and in high school being history, which was my favorite as well as biology, English, and writing.
